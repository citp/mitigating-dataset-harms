Super-resolution is a problem that has been addressed using signal processing methods, but has only recently been tackled using deep learning, especially generative models. We start with a network inspired by Ledig et al [9], explore changes to the network and test our models on various datasets. We train models for both 2x and 4x upsampling and arrive at results that beat simple interpolations. Our 4x GAN is visually comparable to industry standards in deep learning, although trained on a dataset with comparatively few class labels.

In order to identify the diseased cherry leaves in early stage, the authors formulate the cherry leaf disease infected identification as a classification problem and propose a fully automatic identification method based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The GoogLeNet is used as backbone of the CNN. Then, transferred learning techniques are applied to fine-tune the CNN from pre-trained GoogLeNet on ImageNet dataset. This article compares the proposed method against three traditional machine learning methods i.e., support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and back propagation (BP) neural network. Quantitative evaluations conducted on a data set of 1,200 images collected by smart phones, demonstrates that the CNN achieves best precise performance in identifying diseased cherry leaves, with the testing accuracy of 99.6%.

Beside forensic applications, this technology aims at replacing the outdated and attack prone, physical and knowledge-based, proofs of identity. Choosing one biometric characteristic is a tradeoff between universality, acceptability, and permanence, among other factors. Moreover, the accuracy cap of the chosen characteristic may limit the scalability and usability for some applications. The use of multiple biometric sources within a unified frame, i.e. multi-biometrics, aspires to tackle the limitations of single source biometrics and thus enables a wider implementation of the technology. This work aims at presenting application-driven advances in multi-biometrics by addressing different elements of the multi-biometric system work-flow.  At first, practical oriented pre-fusion issues regarding missing data imputation and score normalization are discussed. This includes presenting a novel performance anchored score normalization technique that aligns certain performance-related score values in the fused biometric sources leading to more accurate multi-biometric decisions when compared to conventional normalization approaches. Missing data imputation within score-level multi-biometric fusion is also addressed by analyzing the behavior of different approaches under different operational scenarios.  Within the multi-biometric fusion process, different information sources can have different degrees of reliability. This is usually influenced in the fusion process by assigning relative weights to the fused sources. This work presents a number of weighting approaches aiming at optimizing the decision made by the multi-biometric system. First, weights that try to capture the overall performance of the biometric source, as well as an indication of its confidence, are proposed and proved to outperform the state-of-the-art weighting approaches. The work also introduces a set of weights derived from the identification performance representation, the cumulative match characteristics. The effect of these weights is analyzed under the verification and identification scenarios.  To further optimize the multi-biometric process, information besides the similarity between two biometric captures can be considered. Previously, the quality measures of biometric captures were successfully integrated, which requires accessing and processing raw captures. In this work, supplementary information that can be reasoned from the comparison scores are in focus. First, the relative relation between different biometric comparisons is discussed and integrated in the fusion process resulting in a large reduction in the error rates. Secondly, the coherence between scores of multi-biometric sources in the same comparison is defined and integrated into the fusion process leading to a reduction in the error rates, especially when processing noisy data.  Large-scale biometric deployments are faced by the huge computational costs of running biometric searches and duplicate enrollment checks. Data indexing can limit the search domain leading to faster searches. Multi-biometrics provides richer information that can enhance the retrieval performance. This work provides an optimizable and configurable multi-biometric data retrieval solution that combines and enhances the robustness of rank-level solutions and the performance of feature-level solutions.  Furthermore, this work presents biometric solutions that complement and utilize multi-biometric fusion. The first solution captures behavioral and physical biometric characteristics to assure a continuous user authentication. Later, the practical use of presentation attack detection is discussed by investigating the more realistic scenario of cross-database evaluation and presenting a state-of-the-art performance comparison. Finally, the use of multi-biometric fusion to create face references from videos is addressed. Face selection, feature-level fusion, and score-level fusion approaches are evaluated under the scenario of face recognition in videos.",2018,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0252/256fa23eceb54d9eea50c9fb5c775338d9ea.pdf

The object local appearance location is referenced with respect to an invariant which is a geometric landmark. The appearance (shape and texture) is a combination of Harris–Laplace descriptor and local binary pattern (LBP), all being described by the invariant local appearance model (ILAM). We use an improved variant of LBP traits at regions located by Harris–Laplace detector to encode local appearance. We applied the model to describe and learn object appearances (e.g., faces) and to recognize them. Given the extracted visual traits from a test image, ILAM model is carried out to predict the most similar features to the facial appearance: first, by estimating the highest facial probability and then in terms of LBP histogram-based measure, by computing the texture similarity. Finally, by a geometric calculation the invariant allows to locate an appearance in the image. We evaluate the model by testing it on different face images databases. The experiments show that the model results in high accuracy of detection and provides an acceptable tolerance to the appearance variability.",2017,Pattern Analysis and Applications,,10.1007/s10044-017-0639-2,

However, object appearance is the compositional consequence of both an object's intrinsic and extrinsic causal factors, where the extrinsic causal factors are related to illumination, and imaging conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified tensor model of wholes and parts, and introduces a compositional hierarchical tensor factorization that disentangles the hierarchical causal structure of object image formation, and subsumes multilinear block tensor decomposition as a special case. The resulting object representation is an interpretable combinatorial choice of wholes' and parts' representations that renders object recognition robust to occlusion and reduces training data requirements. We demonstrate ourapproach in the context of face recognition by training on an extremely reduced dataset of synthetic images, and report encouragingface verification results on two datasets - the Freiburg dataset, andthe Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) dataset consisting of real world images, thus, substantiating the suitability of our approach for data starved domains.",2019,ArXiv,1911.0418,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04180.pdf

In this paper, we propose two ideas to meet the above challenges. First, we propose to use individual bins, instead of whole histograms, of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) as features for learning, which yields significant performance improvements and computation reduction in our experiments. Second, we present a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework, called Boosted MTL, for face verification with limited training data.

Just like software inevitably has bugs, models have bugs too, leading to poor classification/prediction accuracy. Unlike software bugs, model bugs cannot be easily fixed by directly modifying models. Existing solutions work by providing additional training inputs. However, they have limited effectiveness due to the lack of understanding of model misbehaviors and hence the incapability of selecting proper inputs. Inspired by software debugging, we propose a novel model debugging technique that works by first conducting model state differential analysis to identify the internal features of the model that are responsible for model bugs and then performing training input selection that is similar to program input selection in regression testing. Our evaluation results on 29 different models for 6 different applications show that our technique can fix model bugs effectively and efficiently without introducing new bugs.

In contrast to prior work, we study complex victim blackbox models, and an adversary lacking knowledge of train/test data used by the model, its internals, and semantics over model outputs. We formulate model functionality stealing as a two-step approach: (i) querying a set of input images to the blackbox model to obtain predictions; and (ii) training a ``knockoff'' with queried image-prediction pairs. We make multiple remarkable observations: (a) querying random images from a different distribution than that of the blackbox training data results in a well-performing knockoff; (b) this is possible even when the knockoff is represented using a different architecture; and (c) our reinforcement learning approach additionally improves query sample efficiency in certain settings and provides performance gains.

It might be assumed that, since these networks are distinct, complex, nonlinear functions, that their embeddings are network specific, and thus have some degree of anonymity. However, recent research has shown that distinct networks' features can be directly mapped with little performance penalty (median 1.9% reduction across 90 distinct mappings) in the context of the 1,000 object ImageNet recognition task. This finding has revealed that embeddings coming from different systems can be meaningfully compared, provided the mapping. However, prior work only considered networks trained and tested on a closed set classification task. Here, we present evidence that a linear mapping between feature spaces can be easily discovered in the context of open set face recognition. Specifically, we demonstrate that the feature spaces of four face recognition models, of varying architecture and training datasets, can be mapped between with no more than a 1.0% penalty in recognition accuracy on LFW . This finding, which we also replicate on YouTube Faces, demonstrates that embeddings from different systems can be readily compared once the linear mapping is determined.

The goal is to create systems that detect, recognize, verify and understand characteristics of human faces. There are significant technical hurdles in making these systems accurate, particularly in unconstrained settings, due to confounding factors related to pose, resolution, illumination, occlusion and viewpoint. However, with recent advances in neural networks, face recognition has achieved unprecedented accuracy, built largely on data-driven deep learning methods. While this is encouraging, a critical aspect limiting face recognition performance in practice is intrinsic facial diversity. Every face is different. Every face reflects something unique about us. Aspects of our heritage – including race, ethnicity, culture, geography – and our individual identity – age, gender and visible forms of self-expression – are reflected in our faces. Faces are personal. We expect face recognition to work accurately for each of us. Performance should not vary for different individuals or different populations. As we rely on data-driven methods to create face recognition technology, we need to answer a fundamental question: does the training data for these systems fairly represent the distribution of faces we see in the world? At the heart of this core question are deeper scientific questions about how to measure facial diversity, what features capture intrinsic facial variation and how to evaluate coverage and balance for face image data sets. Towards the goal of answering these questions, Diversity in Faces (DiF ) provides a new data set of annotations of one million publicly available face images for advancing the study of facial diversity. The annotations are generated using ten facial coding schemes that provide human-interpretable quantitative measures of intrinsic facial features.

To this end, this paper proposes a Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, the encoder-decoder structure of the generator enables DR-GAN to learn a representation that is both generative and discriminative, which can be used for face image synthesis and pose-invariant face recognition. Second, this representation is explicitly disentangled from other face variations such as pose, through the pose code provided to the decoder and pose estimation in the discriminator. Third, DR-GAN can take one or multiple images as the input, and generate one unified identity representation along with an arbitrary number of synthetic face images.

Various models have aimed at capturing this correspondence either through joint modeling of a variational autoencoder or through separate encoder networks that are then concatenated. We present an alternative by proposing a bridged variational autoencoder that allows for learning cross-modal correspondence by incorporating cross-modal hallucination losses in the latent space.

To address this problem, we propose the pixel transposed convolutional layer (PixelTCL) to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. Our method is based on a fresh interpretation of the regular transposed convolutional operation. The resulting PixelTCL can be used to replace any transposed convolutional layer in a plug-and-play manner without compromising the fully trainable capabilities of original models. The proposed PixelTCL may result in slight decrease in efficiency, but this can be overcome by an implementation trick.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the first stage: improving the detectors reliability. Usually the local landmarks detectors are far from perfect. Most often are designed to be fast, having a small support region and are learnt from limited data. As consequence, they will suffer from detection ambiguities. Here we propose to improve the detectors performance by considering multiple detection per landmark. In particular, we propose a joint learning of the detectors by clustering of their training data.

Recently, generative-based image inpainting methods have been shown to produce visually plausible images. However, they still have difficulties to generate the correct structures and colors as the masked region grows large. This drawback is due to the training stability issue of the generative models. This work introduces a new curriculum-style training approach in the context of image inpainting. The proposed method increases the masked region size progressively in training time, during test time the user gives variable size and multiple holes at arbitrary locations. Incorporating such an approach in GANs may stabilize the training and provides better color consistencies and captures object continuities. We validate our approach on the MSCOCO and CelebA datasets.

As a result, adversaries are attracted to using GAN-generated fake images for disinformation campaigns and fraud on social networks. However, training an image generation network to produce realistic-looking samples remains a timeconsuming and difficult problem, so adversaries are more likely to use published GAN models to generate fake images. In this paper, we analyze the frequency domain to attribute and detect fake images generated by a known GAN model. We derive a similarity metric on the frequency domain and develop a new approach for GAN image attribution. We conduct experiments on four trained GAN models and two real image datasets.

In addition, we compare performance of networks trained using unsupervised learning against networks with random filters, and empirically show that learning weights not only is necessary for obtaining good multilayer representations, but also provides robustness to the choice of the network architecture parameters.

Therefore the main goal when operating a vehicle is to safely participate in road-traffic while minimising the adverse effects on our environment. This goal is pursued by road safety measures ranging from safety-oriented road design to driver assistance systems. The latter require exteroceptive sensors to acquire information about the vehicle’s current environment. In this thesis an efficient resource allocation for automotive vision systems is proposed. The notion of allocating resources implies the presence of processes that observe the whole environment and that are able to efficiently direct attentive processes. Directing attention constitutes a decision making process dependent upon the environment it operates in, the goal it pursues, and the sensor resources and computational resources it allocates. The sensor resources considered in this thesis are a subset of the multi-modal sensor system on a test vehicle provided by Audi AG, which is also used to evaluate our proposed resource allocation system. This thesis presents an original contribution in three respects. First, a system architecture designed to efficiently allocate both high-resolution sensor resources and computational expensive processes based upon low-resolution sensor data is proposed. Second, a novel method to estimate 3-D range motion, efficient scan-patterns for spin image based classifiers, and an evaluation of track-to-track fusion algorithms present contributions in the field of data processing methods.

In this paper, we attempt to address this problem. We propose a GMM classifier, SC-GMM, based on the separability criterion in order to separate the Gaussian models as much as possible. This classifier finds the optimal number of Gaussian components for each class based on the separability criterion and then determines the parameters of these Gaussian components by using the expectation maximization algorithm. Extensive experiments have been carried out on classification tasks from general data mining to face verification. Results show that SC-GMM significantly outperforms the original GMM classifier. Results also show that SC-GMM is comparable in classification accuracy to three variants of GMM classifier: Akaike Information Criterion based GMM (AIC-GMM), Bayesian Information Criterion based GMM (BIC-GMM) and variational Bayesian gaussian mixture (VBGM).

A local Fisher discriminant analysis can work well for a multimodal problem. However, it often suffers from the undersampled problem, which makes the local within-class scatter matrix singular. We develop a supervised discriminant analysis technique called uncorrelated regularized local Fisher discriminant analysis for image feature extraction. In this technique, the local within-class scatter matrix is approximated by a full-rank matrix that not only solves the undersampled problem but also eliminates the poor impact of small and zero eigenvalues. Statistically uncorrelated features are obtained to remove redundancy. A trace ratio criterion and the corresponding iterative algorithm are employed to globally solve the objective function.

This is mostly due to the difficulty of simultaneously handling variations in illumination, image misalignment, and occlusion in the test image. We consider a scenario where the training images are well controlled and test images are only loosely controlled. We propose a conceptually simple face recognition system that achieves a high degree of robustness and stability to illumination variation, image misalignment, and partial occlusion. The system uses tools from sparse representation to align a test face image to a set of frontal training images. The region of attraction of our alignment algorithm is computed empirically for public face data sets such as Multi-PIE. We demonstrate how to capture a set of training images with enough illumination variation that they span test images taken under uncontrolled illumination.

As a result, they have been widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging inverse problems like image completion, to problems such as anomaly detection and adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the notion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by the generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the most popular approach, which essentially optimizes for a latent vector that minimizes the discrepancy between a generated image and the given observation. However, PGD is a brittle optimization technique that fails to identify the right projection (or latent vector) when the observation is corrupted, or perturbed even by a small amount. Such corruptions are common in the real world, for example images in the wild come with unknown crops, rotations, missing pixels, or other kinds of non-linear distributional shifts which break current encoding methods, rendering downstream applications unusable. To address this, we propose corruption mimicking—a new robust projection technique, that utilizes a surrogate network to approximate the unknown corruption directly at test time, without the need for additional supervision or data augmentation. The proposed method is significantly more robust than PGD and other competing methods under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby enabling a more effective use of GANs in real-world applications. More importantly, we show that our approach produces state-of-the-art performance in several GAN-based applications—anomaly detection, domain adaptation, and adversarial defense, that benefit from an accurate projection.",2020,International Journal of Computer Vision,1912.07748,10.1007/s11263-020-01310-5,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07748.pdf

To optimize the variational objective of VAE, the reparameterization trick is commonly applied to obtain a lowvariance estimator of the gradient. The main idea of the trick is to express the variational distribution as a differentiable function of parameters and a random variable with a fixed distribution. To extend the reparameterization trick to inference involving discrete latent variables, a common approach is to use a continuous relaxation of the categorical distribution as the approximate posterior. However, when applying continuous relaxation to the multivariate cases, multiple variables are typically assumed to be independent, making it suboptimal in applications where modeling dependency is crucial to the overall performance. In this work, we propose a multivariate generalization of the Relaxed Bernoulli distribution, which can be reparameterized and can capture the correlation between variables via a Gaussian copula.

However, MEC deployments today lack flexible IoT device data handling such as handling user preferences for real-time versus energy-efficient processing. Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel “offload decision-making” algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads. This algorithm also analyzes the impact on energy consumption in the decision-making under different visual data consumption requirements (i.e., users with thick clients or thin clients). To address the processing-throughput versus energy-efficiency tradeoffs, we propose a “Sustainable Policy-based Intelligence-Driven Edge Routing” algorithm that uses machine learning within Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This algorithm is energy aware and improves the geographic routing baseline performance (i.e., minimizes impact of local minima) for throughput performance sustainability, while also enabling flexible policy specification. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on a realistic edge and core cloud testbed in the GENI Cloud infrastructure, and recreate disaster scenes of tornado damages within simulations. Our empirical results show how MEC can provide flexibility to users who desire energy conservation over low latency or vice versa in the visual data processing with a facial recognition application. In addition, our simulation results show that our routing approach outperforms existing solutions under diverse user preferences, node mobility, and severe node failure conditions.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,,10.1109/TMM.2018.2865661,http://cell.missouri.edu/media/publications/2018_08438902.pdf

Recent studies have shown remarkable success for multiple domains but they suffer from two main limitations: they are either built from several two-domain mappings that are required to be learned independently, or they generate low-diversity results, a problem known as mode collapse. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method named GMM-UNIT, which is based on a content-attribute disentangled representation where the attribute space is fitted with a GMM. Each GMM component represents a domain, and this simple assumption has two prominent advantages. First, it can be easily extended to most multi-domain and multi-modal image-to-image translation tasks. Second, the continuous domain encoding allows for interpolation between domains and for extrapolation to unseen domains and translations. Additionally, we show how GMM-UNIT can be constrained down to different methods in the literature, meaning that GMM-UNIT is a unifying framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation.",2020,ArXiv,2003.06788,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06788.pdf

However, the learned metrics may not perform well by leveraging the fixed bounds, especially when the data distributions are complex in practical applications. Besides, most methods attempt to learn a distance metric with a full rank matrix transformation from the given training data, which is not only inefficient to compute but also prone to overfitting.

Therefore, the learned metric is adaptive to different data distributions and robust to avoid overfitting.

However, DR-Cat ignores the correlation information between different features which is useful for classification. In Cat-DR, on the other hand, the correlation information estimated from the training data may not be reliable especially when the number of training samples is limited. We propose a covariance matrix regularization (CMR) technique to solve problems of DR-Cat and Cat-DR. It works by assigning weights to cross-feature covariances in the covariance matrix of training data. Thus the feature correlation estimated from training data is regularized before being used to train the feature fusion model.

The existing methods mostly focus on minimizing a loss defined on sample pairs. However, the numbers of intraclass and interclass sample pairs can be highly imbalanced in many applications, and this can lead to deteriorating or unsatisfactory performances. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a more meaningful performance measure for the imbalanced distribution problem. To tackle the problem as well as to make samples from different modalities directly comparable, a CML method is presented by directly maximizing AUC. The method can be further extended to focus on optimizing partial AUC (pAUC), which is the AUC between two specific 0 positive rates (FPRs). This is particularly useful in certain applications where only the performances assessed within predefined 0 positive ranges are critical. The proposed method is formulated as a log-determinant regularized semidefinite optimization problem. For efficient optimization, a minibatch proximal point algorithm is developed.

The main challenging factors of this research includethe low quality of images (e.g., low resolution, motion blur, and noise), uncontrolledillumination conditions, pose variations, expression changes, and occlusions. In orderto deal with these problems, we propose several face alignment methods using differentstrategies. The _rst part of our work is a three-stage method for facial pointlocalization which can be used for correcting mis-alignment errors. While existingalgorithms mostly rely on a priori knowledge of facial structure and on a trainingphase, our approach works in an online mode without requirements of pre-de_nedconstraints on feature distributions. The proposed method works well on images underexpression and lighting variations. The key contributions of this thesis are aboutjoint image alignment algorithms where a set of images is simultaneously alignedwithout a biased template selection. We respectively propose two unsupervised jointalignment algorithms : \Lucas-Kanade entropy congealing"" (LKC) and \gradient correlationcongealing"" (GCC). In LKC, an image ensemble is aligned by minimizing asum-of-entropy function de_ned over all images. GCC uses gradient correlation coef-_cient as similarity measure. The proposed algorithms perform well on images underdi_erent conditions. To further improve the robustness to mis-alignments and thecomputational speed, we apply a multi-resolution framework to joint face alignmentalgorithms. Moreover, our work is not limited in the face alignment stage. Since facealignment and face acquisition are interrelated, we develop an adaptive appearanceface tracking method with alignment feedbacks. This closed-loop framework showsits robustness to large variations in target's state, and it signi_cantly decreases themis-alignment errors in tracked faces.",2012,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7011/7b802bb446d6d2594d246e34e5e391fa51e0.pdf

The most representative is the emergence of various deep learning accelerators. Among the proposed solutions, resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based process-in-memory (PIM) architecture is anticipated as a promising candidate because ReRAM has the capability of both data storage and in-situ computation. However, we found that existing solutions are unable to efficiently support the computational needs required by the training of unsupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), due to the lack of the following two features: 1) Computation efficiency: GAN utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution. It inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation, resulting in significant resource under-utilization; 2) Data traffic: The data intensive training process of GANs often incurs structural heavy data traffic as well as frequent massive data swaps. Our research follows the PIM strategy by leveraging the energy-efficiency of ReRAM arrays for vector-matrix multiplication to enhance the performance and energy efficiency. Specifically, we propose a novel computation deformation technique that can skip zero-insertions in transposed convolution for computation efficiency improvement. Moreover, we explore an efficient pipelined training procedure to reduce on-chip memory access. The implementation of related circuits and architecture is also discussed.

In this paper, we study the problem of template adaptation, a form of transfer learning to the set of media in a template. Extensive performance evaluations on IJB-A show a surprising result, that perhaps the simplest method of template adaptation, combining deep convolutional network features with template specific linear SVMs, outperforms the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We study the effects of template size, negative set construction and classifier fusion on performance, then compare template adaptation to convolutional networks with metric learning, 2D and 3D alignment.

To do this, the HFRN extracts appearance features as facial parts representations around facial landmark points on the feature maps, globally pool these extracted appearance features onto single feature vectors, and captures the relations for the pairs of appearance features. The HFRN captures the locally detailed relations in the low-level layers and the locally abstracted global relations in the high-level layers for the pairs of appearance features extracted around facial landmark points projected on each layer, respectively.

Inspired by unsupervised feature learning (UFL) within the self-taught learning framework, we propose a method based on UFL, convolution representation, and part-based dimensionality reduction to handle facial age and gender classification, which are two challenging problems under unconstrained circumstances. First, UFL is introduced to learn selective receptive fields (filters) automatically by applying whitening transformation and spherical k-means on random patches collected from unlabeled data. The learning process is fast and has no hyperparameters to tune. Then, the input image is convolved with these filters to obtain filtering responses on which local contrast normalization is applied. Average pooling and feature concatenation are then used to form global face representation. Finally, linear discriminant analysis with part-based strategy is presented to reduce the dimensions of the global representation and to improve classification performances further.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that can leverage all available image and normal data, whether paired or not, thanks to a novel cross-modal learning architecture. In particular, we enable additional training with single modality data, either color or normal, by using two encoder-decoder networks with a shared latent space. The proposed architecture also enables face details to be transferred between the image and normal domains, given paired data, through skip connections between the image encoder and normal decoder. Core to our approach is a novel module that we call deactivable skip connections, which allows integrating both the auto-encoded and image-to-normal branches within the same architecture that can be trained end-to-end. This allows learning of a rich latent space that can accurately capture the normal information.

We show that this is nevertheless insufficient and sub-optimal for the verification problem. This paper proposes to learn a decision function for verification that can be viewed as a joint model of a distance metric and a locally adaptive thresholding rule. We further formulate the inference on our decision function as a second-order large-margin regularization problem, and provide an efficient algorithm in its dual from.

Recent deep learning based methods tailored for face images have achieved improved performance by jointly trained with additional task such as face parsing and landmark prediction. However, multi-task learning requires extra manually labeled data. Besides, most of the existing works can only generate relatively low resolution face images (e.g., 128×128), and their applications are therefore limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel SPatial Attention Residual Network (SPARNet) built on our newly proposed Face Attention Units (FAUs) for face super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce a spatial attention mechanism to the vanilla residual blocks. This enables the convolutional layers to adaptively bootstrap features related to the key face structures and pay less attention to those less feature-rich regions. This makes the training more effective and efficient as the key face structures only account for a very small portion of the face image. Visualization of the attention maps shows that our spatial attention network can capture the key face structures well even for very low resolution faces (e.g., 16×16). Quantitative comparisons on various kinds of metrics (including PSNR, SSIM, identity similarity, and landmark detection) demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-arts. We further extend SPARNet with multi-scale discriminators, named as SPARNetHD, to produce high resolution results (i.e., 512×512).

Furthermore, we discuss recent regularization strategies that were proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that while GAN training with instance noise or gradient penalties converges, Wasserstein-GANs and Wasserstein-GANs-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do in general not converge to the equilibrium point.

In particular we explore two complementary application areas for synthetic face images: 1) Using fully annotated synthetic face images we can study the face recognition rate as a function of interpretable parameters such as face pose. This enables us to systematically analyze the effect of different types of dataset biases on the generalization ability of neural network architectures. Our analysis reveals that deeper neural network architectures can generalize better to unseen face poses. Furthermore, our study shows that current neural network architectures cannot disentangle face pose and facial identity, which limits their generalization ability. 2) We pre-train neural networks with large-scale synthetic data that is highly variable in face pose and the number of facial identities. After a subsequent fine-tuning with real-world data, we observe that the damage of dataset bias in the real-world data is largely reduced.

These impressions have profound social, economic, and political consequences, as they subconsciously influence decisions like voting and criminal sentencing. Therefore, understanding human perception of these judgments is important for the social sciences. In this work, we present a modifying autoencoder (ModifAE, pronounced ``modify'') that can model and alter these facial impressions. We assemble a face impression dataset large enough for training a generative model by applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) impression predictor to faces from CelebA. Then, we apply ModifAE to learn generalizable modifications of these continuous-valued traits in faces (e.g., make a face look slightly more intelligent or much less aggressive). ModifAE can modify face images to create controlled social science experimental datasets, and it can reveal dataset biases by creating direct visualizations of what makes a face salient in social dimensions. The ModifAE architecture is also smaller and faster than SOTA image-to-image translation models, while outperforming SOTA in quantitative evaluations.",2019,CogSci,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/43e9/e3b8f61b9e950633fe7415e8be9ed79c1f22.pdf

More specifically, given a large scale weakly labeled dataset in which each face image is associated with a label, i.e. the name of an identity, we create a graph for each identity with edges linking matched faces verified by the existing model under a tight threshold. Then we use the maximal subgraph as the cleaned data for that identity. With the cleaned dataset, we update the existing face model and use the new model to filter the original dataset to get a larger cleaned dataset. We collect a large weakly labeled dataset containing 530,560 Asian face images of 7,962 identities from the Internet, which will be published for the study of face recognition.

A critical observation that faces of parents captured while they were young are more alike their children's compared with images captured when they are old has been revealed by genetics studies. This enlightens us the following research. First, a new kinship database named UB KinFace composed of child, young parent and old parent face images is collected from Internet. Second, an extended transfer subspace learning method is proposed aiming at mitigating the enormous divergence of distributions between children and old parents. The key idea is to utilize an intermediate distribution close to both the source and target distributions to bridge them and reduce the divergence. Naturally the young parent set is suitable for this task. Through this learning process, the large gap between distributions can be significantly reduced and kinship verification problem becomesmore discriminative.

However, current GAN-based inpainting models fail to explicitly consider the semantic consistency between restored images and original images. For example, given a male image with image region of one eye missing, current models may restore it with a female eye. This is due to the ambiguity of GAN-based inpainting models: these models can generate many possible restorations given a missing region. To address this limitation, our key insight is that semantically interpretable information (such as attribute and segmentation information) of input images (with missing regions) can provide essential guidance for the inpainting process. Based on this insight, we propose a boosted GAN with semantically interpretable information for image inpainting that consists of an inpainting network and a discriminative network. The inpainting network utilizes two auxiliary pretrained networks to discover the attribute and segmentation information of input images and incorporates them into the inpainting process to provide explicit semantic-level guidance. The discriminative network adopts a multi-level design that can enforce regularizations not only on overall realness but also on attribute and segmentation consistency with the original images. Experimental results show that our proposed model can preserve consistency on both attribute and segmentation level, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.",2019,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),1908.04503,10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851926,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04503.pdf

In this paper we move the alignment problem to the learning stage. The result is an efficient pose-aware classifier with no on-line alignment.

Matching face images with different environmental conditions is not a easy task. Also matching face images considering variations such as changing illumination, pose, facial expression and that with uncontrolled conditions becomes more difficult. This paper focuses on accurately recognizing face images considering all the above variations.

Literature suggested that MLBP can give up to 256 orientations for a single radius considered around a pixel and its neighborhood. The paper uses only 8 orientations for a single radius and four such radii (1, 3, 5 and 7) are considered around a single pixel with (8x4) 32 histogram features thus reducing the computational complexity.

Deep learning based facial attribute analysis consists of two basic sub-issues: facial attribute estimation (FAE), which recognizes whether facial attributes are present in given images, and facial attribute manipulation (FAM), which synthesizes or removes desired facial attributes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep facial attribute analysis from the perspectives of both estimation and manipulation. First, we summarize a general pipeline that deep facial attribute analysis follows, which comprises two stages: data preprocessing and model construction. Additionally, we introduce the underlying theories of this two-stage pipeline for both FAE and FAM. Second, the datasets and performance metrics commonly used in facial attribute analysis are presented. Third, we create a taxonomy of state-of-the-art methods and review deep FAE and FAM algorithms in detail.

However their training is well-known to be difficult. This work presents a rigorous statistical analysis of GANs providing straight-forward explanations for common training pathologies such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it proposes a new training objective, Kernel GANs, and demonstrates its practical effectiveness on large-scale real-world data sets. A key element in the analysis is the distinction between training with respect to the (unknown) data distribution, and its empirical counterpart. To overcome issues in GAN training, we pursue the idea of smoothing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) by incorporating noise in the input distributions of the discriminator. As we show, this effectively leads to an empirical version of the JSD in which the 1 and the generator densities are replaced by kernel density estimates, which leads to Kernel GANs.",2018,AISTATS,1705.09199,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09199.pdf

We show that under reasonable assumptions on the annotation process the Bayes risk of the ordinal classifier can be bounded by the expectation of an associated interval-insensitive loss. We propose several convex surrogates of the interval-insensitive loss which are used to formulate convex learning problems.

Several powerful face recognition methods exist, in literature, for controlled environments: constrained illumination, frontal pose, neutral expression... However, there are few reliable methods for the uncontrolled case. Optical correlation has shown its interest through relevant architectures for controlled and uncontrolled environments. Based on this architecture, we propose a novel method for verification and identification tasks under illumination variation conditions. More specifically, we optimize the performances of a correlation method against illumination changes by using and adapting the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) description. This later is widely used in the literature to describe the texture of an image using 8 bits words. For both, target image and reference image, we begin by using a specific-Gaussian function as first step of LBP-VLC correlator. This function filters the considered image with a band-pass filter in order to extract the edges. Then we applied the adapted LBP-VLC method. To validate our new approach, we used a simple POF filter (others correlation filters can be used). The simulations are done using the YaleB and YaleB Extended databases that contain respectively 10 and 38 identities with 64 illuminations. The results obtained reach more than 94% and 92% for the verification and 93% and 90% for the identification case.

As one of the most effective subspace learning methods, low-rank representation (LRR) can improve the robustness of an algorithm by exploring the global representative structure information among the samples. However, the traditional LRR cannot project the training samples into low-dimensional subspace with supervised information. Thus, in this paper, we integrate the properties of LRR with supervised dimensionality reduction techniques to obtain optimal low-rank subspace and discriminative projection at the same time. To achieve this goal, we proposed a novel model named Discriminative Low-Rank Projection (DLRP). Furthermore, DLRP can break the limitation of the small class problem which means the number of projections is bound by the number of classes.

It is not always feasible to train a new model for each attribute, as training of deep neural network based model requires a large number of labelled samples to reliably learn the parameters. Hence, in the proposed framework a similarity score for each attribute is obtained as a weighted combination of all the hidden layer features of the parent model. The weights are attribute specific, and are estimated by minimizing the proposed triplet based hinge loss criteria over small number of labelled samples. Although generic, the proposed approach is developed in the context of a specific application to search for social media profiles of suspects of law enforcement agencies.

Existing work in eye localization achieves high performance on adult datasets but performs poorly in the busy pediatric hospital environment, where face appearance varies because of age, position and the presence of medical equipment. Methods We developed two new datasets: a training dataset using public image data from internet searches, and a test dataset using 59 recordings of patients in a pediatric intensive care unit. We trained two eye localization models, using the Faster R-CNN algorithm to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet base network, and evaluated them using the images from the pediatric ICU. Results The convolutional neural network trained with a combination of adult and child data achieved an 79.7% eye localization rate, significantly higher than the model trained on adult data alone. With additional pre-processing to equalize image contrast, the localization rate rises to 84%. Conclusion The results demonstrate the potential of convolutional neural networks for eye localization and tracking in a pediatric ICU setting, even when training data is limited. We obtained significant performance gains by adding task-specific images to the training dataset, highlighting the need for custom models and datasets for specialized applications like pediatric patient monitoring.

To this end, we initialize the learning parameters of the shallow CNN by the parameters of a deep CNN which is fine-tuned on a small dataset. The depth of the neural network is then decreased by removing some convolutional layers after testing its performance on the validation dataset. As a result, a significantly more accurate shallow CNN architecture, Shallow-GlassNet, is obtained, which achieves not only high accuracy but also high speed in eyeglasses detection.

Most of the research in the field of face presentation attack detection (PAD), was focused on boosting the performance of the systems within a single database. Face PAD datasets are usually captured with RGB cameras, and have very limited number of both bona-fide samples and presentation attack instruments. Training face PAD systems on such data leads to poor performance, even in the closed-set scenario, especially when sophisticated attacks are involved. We explore two paths to boost the performance of the face PAD system against challenging attacks. First, by using multichannel (RGB, Depth and NIR) data, which is still easily accessible in a number of mass production devices. Second, we develop a novel Autoencoders + MLP based face PAD algorithm. Moreover, instead of collecting more data for training of the proposed deep architecture, the domain adaptation technique is proposed, transferring the knowledge of facial appearance from RGB to multi-channel domain. We also demonstrate, that learning the features of individual facial regions, is more discriminative than the features learned from an entire face. The proposed system is tested on a very recent publicly available multi-channel PAD database with a wide variety of presentation attacks.",2019,2019 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB),1907.04048,10.1109/ICB45273.2019.8987247,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04048.pdf

In this work, we propose a Gaussian mixture (GM) loss function for deep neural networks for visual classification. Unlike the softmax cross-entropy loss, our method explicitly shapes the deep feature space towards a Gaussian Mixture distribution. With a classification margin and a likelihood regularization, the GM loss facilitates both high classification performance and accurate modeling of the feature distribution. The GM loss can be readily used to distinguish abnormal inputs, such as the adversarial examples, based on the discrepancy between feature distributions of the inputs and the training set. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that a symmetric feature space can be achieved by using the GM loss, which enables the models to perform robustly against adversarial attacks. The proposed model can be implemented easily and efficiently without using extra trainable parameters. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably not only on image classification but also on robust detection of adversarial examples generated by strong attacks under different threat models.",2020,ArXiv,2011.09066,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09066.pdf

In LGCN, a learnable Gabor filter (LGF) is introduced and combined with the convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the proposed framework is constructed by replacing some first layer convolutional kernels of a standard CNN with LGFs. Here, LGFs learn intrinsic parameters by using standard back propagation method, so that the values of those parameters are no longer fixed by experience as traditional methods, but can be modified by self-learning automatically.

This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation.

This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works.

To solve the problem, we find that segmenting images into semantic fragments could be effective, as discriminative defects and distortions are closely related to such fragments. Besides, to highlight discriminative regions in fragments and to measure contribution to the final prediction of each fragment is efficient for the improvement of generalization ability.

In order to ease this problem, several methods have been introduced in the literature to catalog images automatically. These methods are designed to associate images with one or more keywords belonging to a predefined dictionary or to associate images with visual attributes such as, for example, quality, aesthetics, sentiment, memorability, interestingness, and complexity, etc. This thesis investigates the use of deep convolutional neural network for automatic estimation of image quality and image aesthetics. In the last few years, several methods for automatic image quality assessment have been proposed. Most of them have been designed to deal with synthetically distorted images, which by definition do not truly model distortions afflicting real-world images. In this thesis a method for the automatic quality assessment of authentically distorted images is investigated. It shows better performances than state-of-the-art methods both on synthetically and authentically distorted images datasets. Differently from the image quality, which characterizes the perceived quality of the image signal, aesthetics depicts perceived beauty. As first step, the problem of aesthetic quality assessment of real-life general content images has been investigated. The proposed solution outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the largest publicly available dataset. Given that one of the most popular visual contents is the face (e.g. on social networks for photo sharing), aesthetics assessment is, therefore, further investigated on the specific case of portrait images. To this end, in this thesis an algorithm involving the combination of the previously investigated visual attributes (i.e. quality and aesthetics of general content images) and the facial attributes (i.e. smiling, hair style, makeup) description is proposed. Facial attributes description is achieved thanks to two proposed methods. The first algorithm is a robust smile detector (it represents an important visual feature for portrait aesthetics), the second is a multiple-task model designed in order to simultaneously estimate soft biometrics and attributes such as hair colors and styles, types of beards. While the first algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods (also respect to highly distorted images), the multi-task model demonstrates comparable performance. Experimental results for the portrait image aesthetic assessment thanks to the use of the proposed algorithm show promising performance on three standard datasets.",2018,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/659c/15db147539006b08f238bf3ef5be0a9634f3.pdf

As communication technologies progress, the means to protect data privacy must also evolve to address new challenges come into view. Our research goal in this dissertation is to develop privacy protection frameworks and techniques suitable for the emerging cloud-based data services, in particular privacy-preserving algorithms and protocols for the cloud-based data sharing and data analytics services. Cloud computing has enabled users to store, process, and communicate their personal information through third-party services. It has also raised privacy issues regarding losing control over data, mass harvesting of information, and un-consented disclosure of personal content. Above all, the main concern is the lack of understanding about data privacy in cloud environments. Currently, the cloud service providers either advocate the principle of third-party doctrine and deny users’ rights to protect their data stored in the cloud; or rely the notice-and-choice framework and present users with ambiguous, incomprehensible privacy statements without any meaningful privacy guarantee. In this regard, our research has three main contributions. First, to capture users’ privacy expectations in cloud environments, we conceptually divide personal data into two categories, i.e., visible data and invisible data. The visible data refer to information users intentionally create, upload to, and share through the cloud; the invisible data refer to users’ information retained in the cloud that is aggregated, analyzed, and repurposed without their knowledge or understanding. Second, to address users’ privacy concerns raised by cloud computing, we propose two privacy protection frameworks, namely individual control and use limitation. The individual control framework emphasizes users’ capability to govern the access to the visible data stored in the cloud. The use limitation framework emphasizes users’ expectation to remain anonymous when the invisible data are aggregated and analyzed by cloud-based data services. Finally, we investigate various techniques to accommodate the new privacy protection frameworks, in the context of four cloud-based data services: personal health record sharing, location-based proximity test, link recommendation for social networks, and face tagging in photo management applications. For the first case, we develop a key-based protection technique to enforce fine-grained access control to users’ digital health records. For the second case, we develop a key-less protection technique to achieve location-specific user selection. For latter two cases, we develop distributed learning algorithms to prevent large scale data harvesting. We further combine these algorithms with query regulation techniques to achieve user anonymity. The picture that is emerging from the above works is a bleak one. Regarding to personal data, the reality is we can no longer control them all. As communication technologies evolve, the scope of personal data has expanded beyond local, discrete silos, and integrated into the Internet. The traditional understanding of privacy must be updated to reflect these changes. In addition, because privacy is a particularly nuanced problem that is governed by context, there is no one-size-fit-all solution. While some cases can be salvaged either by cryptography or by other means, in others a rethinking of the trade-offs between utility and privacy appears to be necessary.

A key component behind the success of recent approaches is the self-consistency loss, which encourages a network to recover the original input image when the output generated for a desired attribute is itself passed through the same network, but with the target attribute inverted. While the self-consistency loss yields photo-realistic results, it can be shown that the input and target domains, supposed to be close, differ substantially. This is empirically found by observing that a network recovers the input image even if attributes other than the inversion of the original goal are set as target. This stops one combining networks for different tasks, or using a network to do progressive forward passes. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of this effect, and propose a new loss to bridge the gap between the distributions of the input and target domains. This ""triple consistency loss"", aims to minimise the distance between the outputs generated by the network for different routes to the target, independent of any intermediate steps. To show this is effective, we incorporate the triple consistency loss into the training of a new landmark-guided face to face synthesis, where, contrary to previous works, the generated images can simultaneously undergo a large transformation in both expression and pose. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the problem of mismatching distributions in self-domain synthesis, and to propose ""in-the-wild"" landmark-guided synthesis.

While the core algorithmic problems might seem intractable at first, simple heuristics or approximation algorithms often perform surprisingly well in practice. Common examples include optimizing non-convex functions or optimizing over non-convex sets. In theory, such problems are usually NP-hard. But in practice, they are often solved sufficiently well for applications in machine learning and statistics. Even when a problem is convex, we often settle for sub-optimal solutions returned by inexact methods like stochastic gradient descent. And in nearest neighbor search, a variety of approximation algorithms works remarkably well despite the ""curse of dimensionality"". In this thesis, we study this phenomenon in the context of three fundamental algorithmic problems arising in the data sciences. * In constrained optimization, we show that it is possible to optimize over a wide range of non-convex sets up to the statistical noise floor. "" In unconstrained optimization, we prove that important convex problems already require approximation if we want to find a solution quickly. * In nearest neighbor search, we show that approximation guarantees can explain much of the good performance observed in practice. The overarching theme is that the computational hardness of many problems emerges only below the inherent ""noise floor"" of real data. Hence computational hardness of these problems does not prevent us from finding answers that perform well from a statistical perspective. This offers an explanation for why algorithmic problems in the data sciences often turn out to be easier than expected.

These methods can generate visually plausible image structures and textures, but often create distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. This is mainly due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in explicitly borrowing or copying information from distant spatial locations. On the other hand, traditional texture and patch synthesis approaches are particularly suitable when it needs to borrow textures from the surrounding regions.

Unlike works that start with a predefined set of detected faces, we consider the end-to-end problem of detection and clustering together. We make three separate contributions. First, we combine a state-of-the-art face detector with a generic tracker to extract high quality face tracklets. We then introduce a novel clustering method, motivated by the classic graph theory results of Erdös and Rényi. It is based on the observations that large clusters can be fully connected by joining just a small fraction of their point pairs, while just a single connection between two different people can lead to poor clustering results. This suggests clustering using a verification system with very few 0 positives but perhaps moderate recall. We introduce a novel verification method, rank-1 counts verification, that has this property, and use it in a link-based clustering scheme.

This automatic extraction of soft biometric attributes can happen without the user's agreement, thereby raising several privacy concerns. In this work, we design a technique that modifies a face image such that its gender as assessed by a gender classifier is perturbed, while its biometric utility as assessed by a face matcher is retained.

To address this issue, out-of-sample extension methods have been introduced to generalize an existing embedding of new samples.

To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised learning framework to perform coupled learning of these two distributions based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Specifically, the proposed framework consists of (1) an inference network and a generation network for mapping between the data space and the latent space, and (2) a latent tester and a data tester for performing two-sample tests in these two spaces, respectively. On one hand, we perform a two-sample test between stochastic representations from the prior distribution and inferred representations from the inference network. On the other hand, we perform a two-sample test between the real data and generated data.

Since non-cooperative environments are becoming more and more common, new approaches involving multi-modal biometrics have received more attention. One challenge in multimodal biometric systems is how to integrate the data from different modalities. Initially, we propose a deep transfer learning optimized from a model trained for face recognition achieving outstanding representation for only iris modality. Our feature level fusion by means of features selection targets the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for such aims.

To that end, we start by dividing an image into multiple patches and modifying the role of the generative network from producing an entire image, at once, to creating a sparse representation vector for each image patch. We synthesize an entire image by multiplying generated sparse representations to a pre-trained dictionary and assembling the resulting patches. This approach restricts the output of the generator to a particular structure, obtained by imposing a Union of Subspaces (UoS) model to the original training data, leading to more realistic images, while maintaining a desired diversity. To further regularize GANs in generating high-quality images and to avoid the notorious mode-collapse problem, we introduce a third player in GANs, called reconstructor.

Typically, the proposed OPML first adopts a one-pass triplet construction strategy, which aims to use only a very small number of triplets to approximate the representation ability of whole original triplets obtained by batch-manner methods. Then, OPML employs a closed-form solution to update the metric for new coming samples, which leads to a low space (i.e., O ( d )) and time (i.e., O ( d 2 )) complexity, where d is the feature dimensionality. In addition, an extension of OPML (namely COPML) is further proposed to enhance the robustness when in real case the first several samples come from the same class (i.e., cold start problem). In the experiments, we have systematically evaluated our methods (OPML and COPML) on three typical tasks, including UCI data classification, face verification, and abnormal event detection in videos, which aims to fully evaluate the proposed methods on different sample number, different feature dimensionalities and different feature extraction ways (i.e., hand-crafted and deeply-learned).

The proposed approach first utilizes an external benchmark to generate several illumination templates. Then we combine the generated templates with the training images to simulate different illumination conditions.

Avoiding the use of inaccurate quality labels, we proposed a novel concept to measure face quality based on an arbitrary face recognition model. By determining the embedding variations generated from random subnetworks of a face model, the robustness of a sample representation and thus, its quality is estimated.

These datasets are often crowdsourced from individual users and contain private information like gender, age, etc. The emerging privacy concerns from users on data sharing hinder the generation or use of crowdsourcing datasets and lead to hunger of training data for new deep learning applications. One naive solution is to pre-process the raw data to extract features at the user-side, and then only the extracted features will be sent to the data collector. Unfortunately, attackers can still exploit these extracted features to train an adversary classifier to infer private attributes. Some prior arts leveraged game theory to protect private attributes. However, these defenses are designed for known primary learning tasks, the extracted features work poorly for unknown learning tasks.

The goal of this framework is to learn a feature extractor that can hide the privacy information from the intermediate representations; while maximally retaining the original information embedded in the raw data for the data collector to accomplish unknown learning tasks. We design a hybrid training method to learn the anonymized intermediate representation: (1) an adversarial training process for hiding private information from features; (2) maximally retain original information using a neural-network-based mutual information estimator. We extensively evaluate TIPRDC and compare it with existing methods using two image datasets and one text dataset. Our results show that TIPRDC substantially outperforms other existing methods.

However, conventional methods for manga character recognition are mainly based on handcrafted features which are not robust enough for manga of various style. The emergence of deep learning based methods provides representational features, which has a huge demand for labeled data. In this paper, we propose a framework to exploit unlabeled manga data to facilitate the discriminative capability of deep feature representations for manga character recognition (i.e., unsupervised learning on manga images), which does not rely on any manual annotation. Specifically, we first train an initial feature model using an anime character dataset. Then, we adopt a Progressive Main Characters Mining (PMCM) strategy which iterates between two steps: 1) produce selected data with estimated labels from unlabeled data, 2) update the feature model by the selected data. These two steps are mutually promoted in essence. Experimental results on Manga109 dataset, to which we introduce new head annotations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the usefulness in manga character verification and retrieval.",2019,ACM TUR-C,,10.1145/3321408.3322624,

Existing methods mainly learn a texture mapping model from the source face to the target face. However, they fail to consider the internal deformation caused by the change of poses, leading to the unsatisfactory synthesized results for large pose variations. In this paper, we propose a Gated Deformable Face Synthesis Network to model the deformation of faces that aids the synthesis of the target face image. Specifically, we propose a dual network that consists of two modules. The first module estimates the deformation of two views in the form of convolution offsets according to the input and target poses. The second one, on the other hand, leverages the predicted deformation offsets to create the target face image. In this way, pose changes are explicitly modeled in the face generator to cope with geometric transformation, by adaptively focusing on pertinent regions of the source image. To compensate offset estimation errors, we introduce a soft-gating mechanism that enables adaptive fusion between deformable features and primitive features.

The system differs from existing variational autoencoders (VAEs) in that the prior distribution used to model each code is conditioned on a similar code from the dataset. In compression terms this equates to sequentially transmitting the dataset using an ordering determined by proximity in latent space. Since the prior need only account for local, rather than global variations in the latent space, the coding cost is greatly reduced, leading to rich, informative codes. Crucially, the codes remain informative when powerful, autoregressive decoders are used, which we argue is fundamentally difficult with normal VAEs. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA show that ACNs discover high-level latent features such as object class, writing style, pose and facial expression, which can be used to cluster and classify the data, as well as to generate diverse and convincing samples. We conclude that ACNs are a promising new direction for representation learning: one that steps away from IID modelling, and towards learning a structured description of the dataset as a whole.",2018,ArXiv,1804.02476,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02476.pdf

For improved robustness to intra-class variations, deep Siamese networks have recently been used for pair-wise face matching. Although these networks can improve state-of-the-art accuracy, the absence of prior knowledge from the target domain means that many images must be collected to account for all possible capture conditions, which is not practical for many real-world surveillance applications. In this paper, we propose the deep SiamSRC network that employs block-sparsity for face matching, while the reference gallery is augmented with a compact set of domain-specific facial images. Prior to deployment, clustering based on row sparsity is performed on unlabelled faces captured in videos from the target domain. Cluster centers discovered in the capture condition space (defined by, e.g., pose, scale and illumination) are used as rendering parameters with an off-the-shelf 3D face model, and a compact set of synthetic faces are thereby generated for each reference still based on representative intra-class information from the target domain. For pair-wise similarity matching with query facial images, the SiamSRC exploits sparse representation-based classification with a block structure. Experimental results obtained with the videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets indicate that the proposed SiamSRC network can outperform state-of-the-art methods for still-to-video FR with a single sample per person, with only a moderate increase in computational complexity.",2020,"IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science",,10.1109/TBIOM.2019.2949364,

Compared to the traditional set of code words, this new set uses less number of code words. Furthermore, it can make the distance of the regression targets of different classes as large as possible. Then, correntropy is integrated into the LSR model for better robustness. Furthermore, considering the commonly used distance metrics such as Euclidean distance and Cosine distance in the subspace are invariant to rotation transformation, rotation is introduced as additional freedom to promote flexibility without sacrificing accuracy.

Since it is extremely time-consuming and expensive to annotate adequate data for each classification task, learning an empirically effective model with generalization on small dataset has received increased attention. Existing efforts mainly focus on transferring task-relevant knowledge from other similar data to tackle the issue. These approaches have yielded remarkable improvements, yet neglecting the fact that the task-irrelevant features could bring out massive negative transfer effects. To date, no large-scale studies have been performed to investigate the impact of task-irrelevant features, let alone the utilization of this kind of features. In this paper, we firstly propose Task-Irrelevant Transfer Learning (TIRTL) to exploit task-irrelevant features, which mainly are extracted from task-irrelevant labels. Particularly, we suppress the expression of task-irrelevant information and facilitate the learning process of classification. We also provide a theoretical explanation of our method. In addition, TIRTL does not conflict with those that have previously exploited task-relevant knowledge and can be well combined to enable the simultaneous utilization of task-relevant and task-irrelevant features for the first time. In order to verify the effectiveness of our theory and method, we conduct extensive experiments on facial expression recognition and digit recognition tasks.

We explore the problem of FR with occlusion by embedding Image Gradient Orientations (IGO) into robust error coding. The existing works usually put stress on the error distribution in the non-occluded region but neglect the one in the occluded region due to its unpredictability incurred by irregular occlusion. However, in the IGO domain, the error distribution in the occluded region can be built simply and elegantly by a uniform distribution in the interval $$\left[ -\pi ,\pi \right)$$ - π , π , and the one in the occluded region can be well built by a weight-conditional Gaussian distribution. By incorporating the two error distributions and a Markov random field for the priori distribution of the occlusion support, we propose a joint probabilistic generative model for a novel IGO-embedded Structural Error Coding (IGO-SEC) model. Two methods, a new reconstruction method and a new robust structural error metric, are further presented to boost the performance of IGO-SEC.

Recent researches on this topic largely leverage the adversarial loss so that the generated faces are not only realistic but also well correspond to the target attributes. In this paper, we propose Residual Attribute Generative Adversarial Network (RAG), a novel model to achieve unpaired editing for multiple facial attributes. Instead of directly learning the target attributes, we propose to learn the residual attributes, a more intuitive and understandable representation to convert the original task as a problem of arithmetic addition or subtraction for different attributes. Furthermore, we propose the identity preservation loss, which proves to facilitate convergence and provide better results. At last, we leverage effective visual attention to localize the related regions and preserve the unrelated content during transformation.

DAEs consist of an encoder and decoder which may be trained simultaneously to minimise a loss (function) between an input and the reconstruction of a corrupted version of the input. There are two common loss functions used for training autoencoders, these include the mean-squared error (MSE) and the binary cross-entropy (BCE). When training autoencoders on image data a natural choice of loss function is BCE, since pixel values may be normalised to take values in [0,1] and the decoder model may be designed to generate samples that take values in (0,1). We show theoretically that DAEs trained to minimise BCE may be used to take gradient steps in the data space towards regions of high probability under the data-generating distribution. Previously this had only been shown for DAEs trained using MSE. As a consequence of the theory, iterative application of a trained DAE moves a data sample from regions of low probability to regions of higher probability under the data-generating distribution. Firstly, we validate the theory by showing that novel data samples, consistent with the training data, may be synthesised when the initial data samples are random noise. Secondly, we motivate the theory by showing that initial data samples synthesised via other methods may be improved via iterative application of a trained DAE to those initial samples.",2017,ArXiv,1708.08487,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08487.pdf

The deep latent variable model, trained using variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, is now a key technique for representation learning. However, it is difficult to unify these two models for exact latent-variable inference and parallelize both reconstruction and sampling, partly due to the regularization under the latent variables, to match a simple explicit prior distribution. These approaches are prone to be oversimplified, and can only characterize a few modes of the 1 distribution. Based on the recently proposed Wasserstein autoencoder (WAE) with a new regularization as an optimal transport. The paper proposes a stacked Wasserstein autoencoder (SWAE) to learn a deep latent variable model. SWAE is a hierarchical model, which relaxes the optimal transport constraints at two stages. At the first stage, the SWAE flexibly learns a representation distribution, i.e., the encoded prior; and at the second stage, the encoded representation distribution is approximated with a latent variable model under the regularization encouraging the latent distribution to match the explicit prior. This model allows us to generate natural textual outputs as well as perform manipulations in the latent space to induce changes in the output space. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superior performance of SWAE compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of faithful reconstruction and generation quality.",2019,Neurocomputing,1910.0256,10.1016/J.NEUCOM.2019.06.096,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02560.pdf

Recently, an explosion of research in CA has been witnessed, with several novel probabilistic models proposed (e.g., Probabilistic Principal CA, Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA), Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis). PLDA is a popular generative probabilistic CA method, that incorporates knowledge regarding class-labels and furthermore introduces class-specific and sample-specific latent spaces. While PLDA has been shown to outperform several state-of-the-art methods, it is nevertheless a static model; any feature-level temporal dependencies that arise in the data are ignored. As has been repeatedly shown, appropriate modelling of temporal dynamics is crucial for the analysis of temporal data (e.g., videos). In this light, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, probabilistic LDA formulation that models dynamics, the so-called Dynamic-PLDA (DPLDA). DPLDA is a generative model suitable for video classification and is able to jointly model the label information (e.g., face identity, consistent over videos of the same subject), as well as dynamic variations of each individual video.

The SkData library handles that work for a growing number of benchmark data sets (small and large) so that one-off in-house scripts for downloading and parsing data sets can be replaced with library code that is reliable, community-tested, and documented. The SkData library also introduces an open-ended formalization of training and testing protocols that facilitates direct comparison with published research. This paper describes the usage and architecture of the SkData library. Index Terms—machine learning, cross validation, reproducibility While the neatness of these mathematical abstractions is reflected in the organization of machine learning libraries such as (sklearn), we believe there is a gap in Python's machine learning stack between raw data sets and such neat, abstract interfaces.

Guidelines regarding standard experiment protocols (e.g. which data to use for training) are expressed informally in web page text if at all. The SkData library consolidates myriad little details of idiosyncratic data processing required to run experiments on standard data sets, and packages them as a library of reusable code. It serves as both a gateway to access a growing list of standard public data sets, and as a framework for expressing precise evaluation protocols that correspond to standard ways of using those data sets.

Thus, they may not well represent the test samples and obtain unsatisfactory classification performance. In addition, though different training samples have various contributions to learn a dictionary, conventional dictionary learning algorithms cannot well exploit these contributions. In order to address these problems, we present a test sample oriented two-phase dictionary learning (TSOTP-DL) algorithm for face recognition. In the first phase of the TSOTP-DL algorithm, we use all training samples to provide a linear representation of the test sample, and select K “important” training samples by using the variety of contributions. In the second phase of the TSOTPDL algorithm, a dictionary is learned for the test sample by using the selected K “important” training samples. The TSOTP-DL algorithm utilizes the testing sample to select a subset of the training samples for learning a dictionary, which can reduce the influence of noise. Thus, the training samples are refined according to their contributions to the test sample in our algorithm, and it can improve the discriminative ability of the learned dictionary. In order to further improve the discriminative ability of the learned dictionary, a label embedding of atoms is constructed to encourage the same class training samples to have more similar coding coefficients than different classes.

The ability to extract semantic information by interpreting, indexing and searching visual data is impacting domains such as surveillance, robotics, intelligence, human-computer interaction, navigation, healthcare, and several others. This further stimulates the investigation of automated extraction techniques that are more efficient, and robust against the many sources of noise affecting the already complex visual data, which is carrying the semantic information of interest. We address the problem by designing novel visual data representations, based on learning data subspace decompositions that are invariant against noise, while being informative for the task at hand. We use this guiding principle to tackle several visual recognition problems, including detection and recognition of human interactions from surveillance video, face recognition in unconstrained environments, and domain generalization for object recognition. By interpreting visual data with a simple additive noise model, we consider the subspaces spanned by the model portion (model subspace) and the noise portion (variation subspace). We observe that decomposing the variation subspace against the model subspace gives rise to the so-called parity subspace. Decomposing the model subspace against the variation subspace instead gives rise to what we name invariant subspace. We extend the use of kernel techniques for the parity subspace. This enables modeling the highly non-linear temporal trajectories describing human behavior, and performing detection and recognition of human interactions. In addition, we introduce supervised low-rank matrix decomposition techniques for learning the invariant subspace for two other tasks. We learn invariant representations for face recognition from grossly corrupted images, and we learn object recognition classifiers that are invariant to the socalled domain bias. Extensive experiments using the benchmark datasets publicly available for each of the three tasks, show that learning representations based on subspace decompositions invariant to the sources of noise lead to results comparable or better than the state-ofthe-art.",2017,,,10.33915/etd.6652,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4622/3080936543ffb84e154bad50b711ae9e8322.pdf

However, they are notoriously sensitive to small changes in the input. Most CNNs trained to describe image-to-image mappings generate temporally unstable results when applied to video sequences, leading to flickering artifacts and other inconsistencies over time. In order to use CNNs for video material, previous methods have relied on estimating dense frame-to-frame motion information (optical flow) in the training and/or the inference phase, or by exploring recurrent learning structures. We take a different approach to the problem, posing temporal stability as a regularization of the cost function. The regularization is formulated to account for different types of motion that can occur between frames, so that temporally stable CNNs can be trained without the need for video material or expensive motion estimation. The training can be performed as a fine-tuning operation, without architectural modifications of the CNN. Our evaluation shows that the training strategy leads to large improvements in temporal smoothness. Moreover, for small datasets the regularization can help in boosting the generalization performance to a much larger extent than what is possible with naive augmentation strategies.",2019,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),1902.10424,10.1109/CVPR.2019.01143,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10424.pdf

While practitioners celebrate this as an economical way to obtain synthetic data for training data-hungry machine learning models, it is not clear that they recognize the perils of such an augmentation technique when applied to an already-biased dataset. Although one expects GANs to replicate the distribution of the original data, in real-world settings with limited data and finite network capacity, GANs suffer from mode collapse. Especially when this data is coming from online social media platforms or the web which are never balanced. In this paper, we show that in settings where data exhibits bias along some axes (eg. gender, race), failure modes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) exacerbate the biases in the generated data. More often than not, this bias is unavoidable; we empirically demonstrate that given input of a dataset of headshots of engineering faculty collected from 47 online university directory webpages in the United States is biased toward white males, a state-of-the-art (unconditional variant of) GAN ""imagines"" faces of synthetic engineering professors that have masculine facial features and white skin color (inferred using human studies and a state-of-the-art gender recognition system).

With the recent developments of deep convolutional neural networks and large-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and been widely used in the real-world applications. Given a natural image or video frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs the face feature for recognition. To achieve this, the whole system is generally built with three key elements: face detection, face preprocessing, and face representation. The face detection locates faces in the image or frame. Then, the face preprocessing is proceeded to calibrate the faces to a canonical view and crop them to a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face representation, the discriminative features are extracted from the preprocessed faces for recognition. All of the three elements are fulfilled by deep convolutional neural networks.

Existing approaches suffer from a serious compromise between correct attribute generation and preservation of the other information such as identity and background, because they edit the attributes in the imprecise area. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a progressive attention GAN (PA-GAN) for facial attribute editing. In our approach, the editing is progressively conducted from high to low feature level while being constrained inside a proper attribute area by an attention mask at each level. This manner prevents undesired modifications to the irrelevant regions from the beginning, and then the network can focus more on correctly generating the attributes within a proper boundary at each level. As a result, our approach achieves correct attribute editing with irrelevant details much better preserved compared with the state-of-the-arts.

In this work, we propose two heuristic label propagation algorithms for annotating person identities in stereo videos under the observation that the actors in two consecutive facial images in a video are more likely to be identical. In the light of this, after adjacent video frames divided into several groups, we propose our first algorithm (i.e. ZBLC4) to automatically annotate the unlabeled images with the one having the maximum summed similarity between unlabeled and labeled images in each group in the parameter-free manner. Moreover, to cope with singleton groups, an additional classifier is introduced into ZBLC4 algorithm to mitigate the suffering of unreliable prediction dependent on neighbors. We conduct experiments on three publicly-benchmarking stereo videos, demonstrating that our algorithms are superior to the state-of-the-arts.

Models for such problems usually consist of encoders which decreases spatial resolution while learning a high-dimensional representation, followed by decoders who recover the original input resolution and result in low-dimensional predictions. While encoders have been studied rigorously, relatively few studies address the decoder side. Therefore this paper presents an extensive comparison of a variety of decoders for a variety of pixel-wise prediction tasks. Our contributions are: (1) Decoders matter: we observe significant variance in results between different types of decoders on various problems.

This study proposes a system which can identify the gender based on face image. For finding the location of the face region, each input image is divided into overlapping blocks and Gabor features are extracted with different scale and orientations. Generate the enhanced feature, concatenate mean, standard deviation and skewness of Gabor features which are obtained from each block. For detecting face region, this feature is passed to ensemble classifier. To recognise the gender, reinforced local binary patterns are used to extract the facial local features. Adaboost algorithm is used to select and classify the discriminative features such as male or female. The authors' experimental results on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), FERET and Gallagher databases for face detection using Gabor features achieve 98, 98.5 and 96.5% accuracy, respectively.

However, they are not very accurate in approximating the target distribution in the latent space because they don't have a discriminator to detect the minor difference between real and fake. To this end, we develop a novel non-adversarial framework called Tessellated Wasserstein Auto-encoders (TWAE) to tessellate the support of the target distribution into a given number of regions by the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) technique and design batches of data according to the tessellation instead of random shuffling for accurate computation of discrepancy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the error of estimate to the discrepancy decreases when the numbers of samples $n$ and regions $m$ of the tessellation become larger with rates of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}})$, respectively. Given fixed $n$ and $m$, a necessary condition for the upper bound of measurement error to be minimized is that the tessellation is the one determined by CVT. TWAE is very flexible to different non-adversarial metrics and can substantially enhance their generative performance in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID) compared to VAE, WAE-MMD, SWAE. Moreover, numerical results indeed demonstrate that TWAE is competitive to the adversarial model WAE-GAN, demonstrating its powerful generative ability.",2020,ArXiv,2005.09923,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09923.pdf

Solving this problem opens up a host of applications, such as transcribing archival silent films, or resolving multi- talker simultaneous speech, but most importantly it helps to advance the state of the art in speech recognition by enabling machines to take advantage of the multi-modal nature of human communications. However, visual recognition of speech and gestures is a challenging problem, in part due to the lack of annotations and datasets, but also due to the inter- and intra-personal variations, and in the case of visual speech, ambiguities arising from homophones. Training a deep learning algorithm requires a lot of training data. We propose a method to automatically collect, process and generate a large-scale audio-visual corpus from television videos temporally aligned with the transcript. To build such dataset, it is essential to know 'who' is speaking 'when'. We develop a ConvNet model that learns joint embedding of the sound and the mouth images from unlabelled data, and apply this network to the tasks of audio-to-video synchronisation and active speaker detection. Not only does this play a crucial role in building the dataset that forms the basis of much of the research done in this thesis, the method learns powerful representations of the visual and auditory inputs which can be used for related tasks such as lip reading. We also show that the methods developed here can be extended to the problem of generating talking faces from audio and still images. We then propose a number of deep learning models that are able to recognise visual speech at word and sentence level. In both scenarios, we also demonstrate recognition performance that exceeds the state of the art on public datasets; and in the case of the latter, the lip reading performance beats a professional lip reader on videos from BBC television. We also demonstrate that if audio is available, then visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance. Next, we present a method to recognise and localise short temporal signals in image time series, where strong supervision is not available for training. We propose image encodings and ConvNet-based architectures to first recognise the signal, and then to localise the signal using back-propagation. The method is demonstrated for localising spoken words in audio, and for localising signed gestures in British Sign Language (BSL) videos. Finally, we explore the problem of speaker recognition. Whereas previous works for speaker identification have been limited to constrained conditions, here we build a new large-scale speaker recognition dataset collected from 'in the wild' videos using an automated pipeline.

In this paper, we propose a framework to enable utilizing discrete multi-labels to control which features to be disentangled, i.e., disentangling label-specific fine-grained features for image manipulation (dubbed DLGAN). By mapping the discrete label-specific attribute features into a continuous prior distribution, we leverage the advantages of both discrete labels and reference images to achieve image manipulation in a hybrid fashion. For example, given a face image dataset (e.g., CelebA) with multiple discrete fine-grained labels, we can learn to smoothly interpolate a face image between black hair and blond hair through reference images while immediately controlling the gender and age through discrete input labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes such a hybrid manipulation within a single model. More importantly, it is the first work to achieve image interpolation between two different domains without requiring continuous labels as the supervision.

MeshFaces provide a simple and inexpensive way to protect facial photos and have been widely used in China. This paper treats MeshFace generation and removal as a dual learning problem and proposes a high-order relation-preserving CycleGAN framework to solve this problem. First, dual transformations between the distributions of MeshFaces and clean faces in pixel space are learned under the CycleGAN framework, which can efficiently utilize unpaired data. Then, a novel High-order Relation-preserving (HR) loss is imposed on CycleGAN to recover the finer texture details and generate much sharper images. Different from the L1 and L2 losses that result in image smoothness and blurry, the HR loss can better capture the appearance variation of MeshFaces and hence facilitates removal. Moreover, Identity Preserving loss is proposed to preserve both global and local identity information.

Many schemes have emerged to enhance the performance of face recognition to deal with poor quality facial images. It has been shown that reporting average accuracy, to cover a wide range of image quality, does not reflect the system's for any specific quality levels. This raises the need to evaluate biometric system's performance at each quality level separately. Challenging face databases have been recorded with varied face image qualities. Unfortunately, the performance of face recognition schemes under different quality conditions, reported in the literature, are evaluated under hidden assumption which cannot be achieved in real-life applications. In fact, this problem could be a source of attack that interferes with the verification through manipulating the recording condition. In order to remedy this problem, two requirements are to be imposed: 1) the matching criteria should be based an Adaptive Quality-Based Threshold (AQBT) and 2) at the verification stage the quality level of an input face image should be determined and classified into one of a non-overlapping predefined quality levels. We illustrate our idea by experiments conducted on the extended Yale B face benchmark dataset.

The encoder is used to learn the universal information among different domains. The reconstructor is designed to extract the hierarchical representations of the images by minimizing the reconstruction loss. The translators are used to perform the multi-domain translation. Each translator and reconstructor are connected to a discriminator for adversarial training. Importantly, the high-level representations are shared between the source and multiple target domains, and all network structures are trained together by using a joint loss function. In particular, instead of using a random vector z as inputs to generate high-resolution images, UMT-GAN rather employs the source domain images as the inputs of the generator, hence help the model escape from collapsing to a certain extent.

Recent studies on recognition of fine-grained actions/gestures in monocular images have mainly focused on modeling spatial configuration of body parts representing body pose, human-objects interactions and variations in local appearance. The results show that this is a brittle approach since it relies on the accurate body parts/objects detection. In this work, we argue that there exist local discriminative semantic regions, whose “informativeness” can be evaluated by the attention mechanism for inferring fine-grained gestures/actions. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end Regional Attention Network (RAN), which is a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to combine multiple contextual regions through attention mechanism, focusing on parts of the images that are most relevant to a given task.

d88207e1edff90a549413fafd71abafc7afa9838,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Robust graph transduction,"Given a weighted graph, graph transduction aims to assign unlabeled examples explicit class labels rather than build a general decision function based on the available labeled examples. Practically, a dataset usually contains many noisy data, such as the “bridge points” located across different classes, and the “outliers” that incur abnormal distances from the normal examples of their classes. The labels of these examples are usually ambiguous and also difficult to decide. Labeling them incorrectly may further bring about erroneous classifications on the remaining unlabeled examples. Therefore, their accurate classifications are critical to obtaining satisfactory final performance. Unfortunately, current graph transduction algorithms usually fall short of tackling the noisy but critical examples, so they may become fragile and produce imperfect results sometimes. Therefore, in this thesis we aim to develop a series of robust graph transduction methodologies via iterative or non-iterative way, so that they can perfectly handle the difficult noisy data points. Our works are summarized as follows: In Chapter 2, we propose a robust non-iterative algorithm named “Label Prediction via Deformed Graph Laplacian” (LPDGL). Different from the existing methods that usually employ a traditional graph Laplacian to achieve label smoothness among pairs of examples, in LPDGL we introduce a deformed graph Laplacian, which not only induces the existing pairwise smoothness term, but also leads to a novel local smoothness term. This local smoothness term detects the ambiguity of each example by exploring the associated degree, and assigns confident labels to the examples with large degree, as well as allocates “weak labels” to the uncertain examples with small degree. As a result, the negative effects of outliers and bridge points are suppressed, leading to more robust transduction performance than some existing representative algorithms. Although LPDGL is designed for transduction purpose, we show that it can be easily extended to inductive settings. In Chapter 3, we develop an iterative label propagation approach, called “Fick’s Law Assisted Propagation” (FLAP), for robust graph transduction. To be specific, we regard label propagation on the graph as the practical fluid diffusion on a plane, and develop a novel label propagation algorithm by utilizing a well-known physical theory called Fick’s Law of Diffusion. Different from existing machine learning models that are based on some heuristic principles, FLAP conducts label propagation in a “natural” way, namely when and how much label information is received or transferred by an example, or where these labels should be propagated to, are naturally governed. As a consequence, FLAP not only yields more robust propagation results, but also requires less computational time than the existing iterative methods. In Chapter 4, we propose a propagation framework called “Teachingto-Learn and Learning-to-Teach” (TLLT), in which a “teacher” (i.e. a teaching algorithm) is introduced to guide the label propagation. Different from existing methods that equally treat all the unlabeled examples, in TLLT we assume that different examples have different classification difficulties, and their propagations should follow a simple-to-difficult sequence. As such, the previously “learned” simple examples can ease the learning for the subsequent more difficult examples, and thus these difficult examples can be correctly classified. In each iteration of propagation, the teacher will designate the simplest examples to the “learner” (i.e. a propagation algorithm). After “learning” these simplest examples, the learner will deliver a learning feedback to the teacher to assist it in choosing the next simplest examples. Due to the collaborative teaching and learning process, all the unlabeled examples are propagated in a well-organized sequence, which contributes to the improved performance over existing methods. In Chapter 5, we apply the TLLT framework proposed in Chapter 4 to accomplish saliency detection, so that the saliency values of all the superpixels are decided from simple superpixels to more difficult ones. The difficulty of a superpixel is judged by its informativity, individuality, inhomogeneity, and connectivity. As a result, our saliency detector generates manifest saliency maps, and outperforms baseline methods on the typical public datasets.",2016,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/19e0/13bfe1be379909a0b48cf752a59f2d3af47c.pdf

Such face with very low-resolution is totally out of detail information of the face identity compared to normal resolution in a gallery and hard to find corresponding faces therein. To this end, we propose a Resolution Invariant Model (RIM) for addressing such cross-resolution face recognition problems, with three distinct novelties. First, RIM is a novel and unified deep architecture, containing a Face Hallucination sub-Net (FHN) and a Heterogeneous Recognition sub-Net (HRN), which are jointly learned end to end.

Third, HRN is a generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for heterogeneous face recognition with our proposed residual knowledge distillation strategy for learning discriminative yet generalized feature representation.

The proposed genetic algorithm uses a small length chromosome to decrease the search space, and hence the results could be obtained in a short time. Two datasets were used to test the proposed method which are AR Face database and LFW database of face, the overall matching and recognition accuracy were calculated based on conducting sequences of experiments on random sub-datasets, where the overall matching and recognition accuracy was 91.7% and 90% respectively.

Inspired by analogical reasoning in the human mind, a feasible strategy is to translate the abundant images of a rich source domain to enrich the relevant yet different target domain with insufficient image data. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel, effective multi-adversarial framework (MA) based on part-global learning, which accomplishes one-shot cross-domain image-to-image translation. In specific, we first devise a part-global adversarial training scheme to provide an efficient way for feature extraction and prevent discriminators being over-fitted. Then, a multi-adversarial mechanism is employed to enhance the image-to-image translation ability to unearth the high-level semantic representation. Moreover, a balanced adversarial loss function is presented, which aims to balance the training data and stabilize the training process.

However, since GAN and most of its variants use randomly sampled noises as the input of their generators, they have to learn a mapping function from a whole random distribution to the image manifold. As the structures of the random distribution and the image manifold are generally different, this results in GAN and its variants difficult to train and converge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep model called generative adversarial networks with decoder-encoder output noises (DE-GANs), which take advantage of both the adversarial training and the variational Bayesian inference to improve GAN and its variants on image generation performances. DE-GANs use a pre-trained decoder-encoder architecture to map the random noise vectors to informative ones and feed them to the generator of the adversarial networks. Since the decoder-encoder architecture is trained with the same data set as the generator, its output vectors, as the inputs of the generator, could carry the intrinsic distribution information of the training images, which greatly improves the learnability of the generator and the quality of the generated images.

The analysis is performed by actively reconstructing the three-dimensional face from the image in an Analysis-by-Synthesis loop, exploring statistical models for shape and appearance. Here we follow a probabilistic approach to acquire a robust and automatic model adaptation. The probabilistic formulation helps to overcome two main limitations of the classical approach. First, Morphable Model adaptation is highly depending on a good initialization. The initial position of landmark points and face pose was given by manual annotation in previous approaches. Our fully probabilistic formulation allows us to integrate unreliable Bottom-Up cues from face and feature point detectors. This integration is superior to the classical feed-forward approach, which is prone to early and possibly wrong decisions. The integration of uncertain Bottom-Up detectors leads to a fully automatic model adaptation process. Second, the probabilistic framework gives us a natural way to handle outliers and occlusions. Face images are recorded in highly unconstrained settings. Often parts of the face are occluded by various objects. Unhandled occlusions can mislead the model adaptation process. The probabilistic interpretation of our model makes possible to detect and segment occluded parts of the image and leads to robust model adaptation. Throughout this chapter we develop a fully probabilistic framework for image interpretation. We start by reformulating the Morphable Model as a probabilistic model in a fully Bayesian framework. Given an image, we search for a posterior distribution of possible image explanations. The integration of Bottom-Up information and the model parameters adaptation is performed using a Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. The face model is extended to be occlusion-aware and explicitly segments the image into face and non-face regions during the model adaptation process. The segmentation and model adaptation is performed in an Expectation-Maximization-style algorithm utilizing a robust illumination estimation method. The presented fully automatic face model adaptation can be used in a wide range of applications like face analysis, face recognition or face image manipulation. Our framework is able to handle images containing strong outliers, occlusions and facial expressions under arbitrary poses and illuminations.

Improvements on this task would also have important theoretical implications, as a successful solution in low-shot learning would likely also push the boundary in representation learning, natural language or image understanding, etc. Matching networks are a recently proposed model for low-shot learning that combine neural networks with nonparametric models. They were shown to perform well on benchmark low-shot learning tasks, highlighting the potential of this approach. To better understand the strengths and shortcomings of this family of models, in this work, we compare matching networks and several variants, against a strong baseline when applied to a diverse set of tasks.

In this work, we propose a framework, called InterFaceGAN, to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and thoroughly analyze the properties of the facial semantics in the latent space. We first find that GANs actually learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the latent space when being trained to synthesize high-quality faces. After identifying the subspaces of the corresponding latent semantics, we are able to realistically manipulate the facial attributes occurring in the synthesized images without retraining the model.

However, most of these methods use the original face images without any preprocessing for recognition. Thus, their performances may be affected by some problematic factors (such as illumination and expression variances) in the face images. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel supervised filter learning algorithm is proposed for representation based face recognition in this paper. The underlying idea of our algorithm is to learn a filter so that the within-class representation residuals of the faces' Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are minimized and the between-class representation residuals of the faces' LBP features are maximized. Therefore, the LBP features of filtered face images are more discriminative for representation based classifiers. Furthermore, we also extend our algorithm for heterogeneous face recognition problem.

However, due to the difficulties of controlling the structure and texture in high-resolution, it is challenging to simultaneously model pose and expression during manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies face manipulation with extreme pose and expression into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a disentangled face synthesis stage. In the first stage, we propose to use a boundary image for joint pose and expression modeling. An encoder-decoder network is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a semi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are used to improve the prediction accuracy. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image and the original face are encoded into the structure and texture latent space by two encoder networks respectively. A proxy network and a feature threshold loss are further imposed as constraints to disentangle the latent space. In addition, we build up a new high quality Multi-View Face (MVF-HQ) database that contains 120K high-resolution face images of 479 identities with pose and expression variations, which will be released soon. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on four databases show that our method pushes forward the advance of extreme face manipulation from 128 $\times$ 128 resolution to 1024 $\times$ 1024 resolution, and significantly improves the face recognition performance under large poses.",2019,ArXiv,1903.12003,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12003.pdf

Many existing ensembles of face recognition CNNs apply a two-stage pipeline to target performance improvement [10], [20], [22], [23], [29]: (1) it trains multiple CNNs separately with many face patches covering different facial areas; (2) the features derived from different models are aggregated off-line by different fusion methods. The well-known face recognition work, DeepID2 [20] trains 200 networks based on 200 arbitrarily chosen facial areas and chooses the best 25 ones to achieve impressive performance. However, it is very time-consuming to train so many networks. In addition, a brute-force like way of choosing facial patches is used without knowing which face patches are complementary and discriminative. It might be lack of generalization capability for cross-database applications. To solve that, we propose a novel end-to-end CNN ensemble architecture which automatically learns the complementary and discriminative patches for face recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel Patch Generation Engine (PGE) with Patch Search Spatial Transformer Network (PS-STN) and ROI shrunk loss to perform the patch selection process. ROI shrunk loss enlarges the distance of learned features in spatial space and feature space and learn complementary features. In order to get final aggregated feature, we use a supervised fusion module named Two Stage Discriminative Fusion Module (TSDFM) which effective to capture the global and local information and further guide the PGE to learn better patches.

A novel resolution enhancement technique is proposed for enhancing a low resolution face image into a high resolution image for better visualization and improved feature extraction, especially in a video surveillance environment. This method performs kernel regression and component feature learning in local neighborhood of the face images. It uses directional Fourier phase feature component to adaptively lean the regression kernel based on local covariance to estimate the high resolution image. For each patch in the neighborhood, four directional variances are estimated to adapt the interpolated pixels. A Modified Local Binary Pattern (MLBP) methodology for feature extraction is proposed to obtain robust face recognition under varying lighting conditions. Original LBP operator compares pixels in a local neighborhood with the center pixel and converts the resultant binary string to 8-bit integer value. So, it is less effective under difficult lighting conditions where variation between pixels is negligible. The proposed MLBP uses a two stage encoding procedure which is more robust in detecting this variation in a local patch. A novel dimensionality reduction technique called Marginality Preserving Embedding (MPE) is also proposed for enhancing the face recognition accuracy. Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which project data in a global sense, MPE seeks for a local structure in the manifold. This is similar to other subspace learning techniques but the difference with other manifold learning is that MPE preserves marginality in local reconstruction. Hence it provides better representation in low dimensional space and achieves lower error rates in face recognition. Two new concepts for robust face recognition are also presented in this dissertation. In the first approach, a neural network is used for training the system where input vectors are created by measuring distance from each input to its class mean. In the second approach, half-face symmetry is used, realizing the fact that the face images may contain various expressions such as open/close eye, open/close mouth etc., and classify the top half and bottom half separately and finally fuse the two results. By performing experiments on several standard face datasets, improved results were observed in all the new proposed methodologies. Research is progressing in developing a unified approach for the extraction of features suitable for accurate face recognition in a long range video sequence in complex environments.",2012,,,10.25777/F12J-ZX22,

However, VAEs are known to suffer from over-regularization which can lead to failure to escape local maxima. This phenomenon, known as posterior collapse, prevents learning a meaningful latent encoding of the data. Recent methods have mitigated this issue by deterministically moment-matching an aggregated posterior distribution to an aggregate prior. However, abandoning a probabilistic framework (and thus relying on point estimates) can both lead to a discontinuous latent space and generate unrealistic samples. Here we present Hierarchical Empirical Bayes Autoencoder (HEBAE), a computationally stable framework for probabilistic generative models. Our key contributions are two-fold. First, we make gains by placing a hierarchical prior over the encoding distribution, enabling us to adaptively balance the trade-off between minimizing the reconstruction loss function and avoiding over-regularization. Second, we show that assuming a general dependency structure between variables in the latent space produces better convergence onto the mean-field assumption for improved posterior inference. Overall, HEBAE is more robust to a wide-range of hyperparameter initializations than an analogous VAE. Using data from MNIST and CelebA, we illustrate the ability of HEBAE to generate higher quality samples based on FID score than existing autoencoder-based approaches.",2020,ArXiv,2007.10389,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10389.pdf

However, random sampling may miss rare errors for which the model is highly confident in its prediction, but wrong. These high-confidence errors can represent costly mistakes, and therefore should be explicitly searched for. Past works have developed search techniques to find classification errors above a specified confidence threshold, but ignore the fact that errors should be expected at confidence levels anywhere below 100%. In this work, we investigate the problem of finding errors at rates greater than expected given model confidence.

In this paper, we propose to learn a part-based feature representation under the supervision of face identities through a deep model that ensures that the generated representations are more robust and suitable for face verification. The proposed framework consists of the following two deliberate components: 1) a deep mixture model (DMM) to find accurate patch correspondence and 2) a convolutional fusion network (CFN) to extract the part-based facial features. Specifically, DMM robustly depicts the spatial-appearance distribution of patch features over the faces via several Gaussian mixtures, which provide more accurate patch correspondence even in the presence of local distortions. Then, DMM only feeds the patches which preserve the identity information to the following CFN. The proposed CFN is a two-layer cascade of convolutional neural networks: 1) a local layer built on face patches to deal with local variations and 2) a fusion layer integrating the responses from the local layer. CFN jointly learns and fuses multiple local responses to optimize the verification performance.

Instead of using the least-squares method during the training process of regressors, sparse constraint is introduced to select robust features and compress the size of the model. Moreover, sparse shape constraint is incorporated between each cascade regression, and the explicit shape constraints are able to suppress the ambiguity in local features. To improve the model's adaptation to large pose variation, face pose is estimated by five fiducial landmarks located by deep convolutional neuron network, which is used to adaptively design the cascade regression model.

We start from the insight that the problem of frame interpolation implicitly solves for inter-frame correspondences. This permits the application of analysis-by-synthesis: we first train and apply a Convolutional Neural Network for frame interpolation, then obtain correspondences by inverting the learned CNN. The key benefit behind this strategy is that the CNN for frame interpolation can be trained in an unsupervised manner by exploiting the temporal coherence that is naturally contained in real-world video sequences. The present model therefore learns image matching by simply “watching videos”. Besides a promise to be more generally applicable, the presented approach achieves surprising performance comparable to traditional empirically designed methods.",2016,ECCV,1603.06041,10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4_26,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06041.pdf

In this paper, we propose a one-off and attack-agnostic Feature Manipulation (FM)-Defense to detect and purify adversarial examples in an interpretable and efficient manner. The intuition is that the classification result of a normal image is generally resistant to non-significant intrinsic feature changes, e.g., varying thickness of handwritten digits. In contrast, adversarial examples are sensitive to such changes since the perturbation lacks transferability. To enable manipulation of features, a combo-variational autoencoder is applied to learn disentangled latent codes that reveal semantic features. The resistance to classification change over the morphs, derived by varying and reconstructing latent codes, is used to detect suspicious inputs. Further, combo-VAE is enhanced to purify the adversarial examples with good quality by considering both class-shared and class-unique features. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of detection and the quality of purified instance. Our experiments on three datasets show that FM-Defense can detect nearly $100\%$ of adversarial examples produced by different state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. It achieves more than $99\%$ overall purification accuracy on the suspicious instances that close the manifold of normal examples.",2020,ArXiv,2002.02007,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02007.pdf

In this model, the occlusion probability of each position in high-level features are inferred by a distillation module that can be learnt automatically in the process of estimating the relationship between facial appearance and facial shape. The occlusion probability serves as the adaptive weight on high-level features to reduce the impact of occlusion and obtain clean feature representation. Nevertheless, the clean feature representation cannot represent the holistic face due to the missing semantic features. To obtain exhaustive and complete feature representation, it is vital that we leverage a low-rank learning module to recover lost features. Considering that facial geometric characteristics are conducive to the low-rank module to recover lost features, we propose a geometry-aware module to excavate geometric relationships between different facial components. Depending on the synergistic effect of three modules, the proposed network achieves better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmark datasets.",2019,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),,10.1109/CVPR.2019.00360,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhu_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection_via_Occlusion-Adaptive_Deep_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf

Researchers proposed various approaches to enable image privacy, most of which focus on encrypting or distorting image visual content. In this thesis, we investigate novel solutions to protect image privacy with a particular emphasis on online photo sharing. To this end, we propose not only algorithms to protect visual privacy in image content but also design of architectures for privacy-preserving photo sharing. Beyond privacy, we also explore additional impacts and potentials of employing daily images in other three relevant applications. First, we propose and study two image encoding algorithms to protect visual content in image, within a Secure JPEG framework. The first method scrambles a JPEG image by randomly changing the signs of its DCT coefficients based on a secret key. The second method, named JPEG Transmorphing, allows one to protect arbitrary image regions with any obfuscation, while secretly preserving the original image regions in application segments of the obfuscated JPEG image. Performance evaluations reveal a good degree of storage overhead and privacy protection capability for both methods, and particularly a good level of pleasantness for JPEG Transmorphing, if proper manipulations are applied. Second, we investigate the design of two architectures for privacy-preserving photo sharing. The first architecture, named ProShare, is built on a public key infrastructure (PKI) integrated with a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), to enable the secure and efficient access to user-posted photos protected by Secure JPEG. The second architecture is named ProShare S, in which a photo sharing service provider helps users make photo sharing decisions automatically based on their past decisions using machine learning. The photo sharing service analyzes not only the content of a user's photo, but also context information about the image capture and a prospective requester, and finally makes decision whether or not to share a particular photo to the requester, and if yes, at which granularity. A user study along with extensive evaluations were performed to validate the proposed architecture. In the end, we research into three relevant topics in regard to daily photos captured or shared by people, but beyond their privacy implications. In the first study, inspired by JPEG Transmorphing, we propose an animated JPEG file format, named aJPEG. aJPEG preserves its animation frames as application markers in a JPEG image and provides smaller file size and better image quality than conventional GIF. In the second study, we attempt to understand the impact of popular image manipulations applied in online photo sharing on evoked emotions of observers. The study reveals that image manipulations indeed influence people's emotion, but such impact also depends on the image content. In the last study, we employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), the GoogLeNet model, to perform automatic food image detection and categorization. The promising results obtained provide meaningful insights in design of automatic dietary assessment system based on multimedia techniques, e.g. image analysis.",2017,,,10.5075/EPFL-THESIS-7828,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f7d6/4f6c88623acd53c7aff9d6062f749a464325.pdf

However, the matching ambiguity between young and aged face images inherent to unpaired training data may lead to unnatural changes of facial attributes during the aging process, which could not be solved by only enforcing identity consistency like most existing studies do. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware face aging model with wavelet based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address the above issues. To be specific, we embed facial attribute vectors into both the generator and discriminator of the model to encourage each synthesized elderly face image to be faithful to the attribute of its corresponding input. In addition, a wavelet packet transform (WPT) module is incorporated to improve the visual fidelity of generated images by capturing age-related texture details at multiple scales in the frequency space. Qualitative results demonstrate the ability of our model in synthesizing visually plausible face images, and extensive quantitative evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.",2019,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),1809.06647,10.1109/CVPR.2019.01215,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06647.pdf

A popular method which aligns images and simultaneously estimates a simple statistical shape model was proposed by E. Learned-Miller and is known as.congealing. It considers the entropy of a simple, pixel-wise independent distribution as the objective function for searching the unknown transformations. Besides being intuitive and appealing, this idea raises several theoretical and practical questions, which we try to answer in this paper. First, we analyse the approach theoretically and show that the original congealing is in fact the DC-dual task (difference of convex functions) for a properly formulated Maximum Likelihood estimation task. This interpretation immediately leads to a different choice for the algorithm which is substantially simpler than the known congealing algorithm. The second contribution is to show, how to generalise the task for models in which the shape prior is formulated in terms of segmentation labellings and is related to the signal domain via a parametric appearance model. We call this generalisation unsupervised congealing. The new approach is applied to the task of aligning and segmenting imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster larvae.",2015,IPMI,,10.1007/978-3-319-19992-4_27,http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~flachbor/publications/ipmi2015_fin.pdf

Unlike the prior works on the facial attribute parsing, we aim at an inverse and more challenging problem called attribute manipulation by modifying a facial image in line with a reference facial attribute. Given a source input image and reference images with a target attribute, our goal is to generate a new image (i.e., target image) that not only possesses the new attribute but also keeps the same or similar content with the source image. In order to generate new facial attributes, we train a deep neural network with a combination of a perceptual content loss and two adversarial losses, which ensure the global consistency of the visual content while implementing the desired attributes often impacting on local pixels. The model automatically adjusts the visual attributes on facial appearances and keeps the edited images as realistic as possible. The evaluation shows that the proposed model can provide a unified solution to both local and global facial attribute manipulation such as expression change and hair style transfer. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the learned attribute discriminator can be used for attribute localization.",2018,2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),,10.1109/WACV.2018.00019,http://www.public.asu.edu/~swang187/publications/WACV18.pdf

Our approach uses a 3DMM-based coarse model and a displacement map in UV-space to represent a 3D face. Unlike previous work addressing the problem, our learning framework does not require supervision of surrogate ground-truth 3D models computed with traditional approaches. Instead, we utilize the input image itself as supervision during learning. In the first stage, we combine a photometric loss and a facial perceptual loss between the input face and the rendered face, to regress a 3DMM-based coarse model. In the second stage, both the input image and the regressed texture of the coarse model are unwrapped into UV-space, and then sent through an image-to-image translation network to predict a displacement map in UV-space. The displacement map and the coarse model are used to render a final detailed face, which again can be compared with the original input image to serve as a photometric loss for the second stage. The advantage of learning displacement map in UV-space is that face alignment can be explicitly done during the unwrapping, thus facial details are easier to learn from large amount of data.

We design two sub-networks, namely correspondence fine-tuning and multiple GAN inversion, and optimize these network parameters and latent codes, starting from the pre-trained ones, with well-defined loss functions. Our framework does not require the off-line training phase, which has been the main challenge of existing methods, but the pre-trained networks to enable optimization in online.

In this paper, an new locality constrained dictionary learning algorithm (LCDL) for face recognition by using the locality characters of atoms is proposed. Since the atoms are learned from the training samples, they are more robust to the noise and outliers than training samples. In the LCDL algorithm, we use atoms to construct a Laplacian graph, and then use the profile (the row vector of coding coefficients matrix) to measure the similarity among them. Then, we construct a locality constraint term by using the profile matrix and Laplacian graph of atoms. Since the profile and atoms can be adaptively updated in dictionary learning processing, the locality constraint term also can be adaptively updated. Moreover, the locality constraint term also can inherit the geometrical structure of the training samples, and it can enhance discriminative ability of the dictionary.
